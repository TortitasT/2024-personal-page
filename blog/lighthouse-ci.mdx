I discovered Lighthouse about two years about when working on an
E-Commerce, we made weekly tests via Chrome DevTools and it was a
great tool to find performance issues.

It was a manual process, we had to open Chrome DevTools, run the
Lighthouse audit and then check the results.

This week I discovered Lighthouse CI, a tool to automate the process
and I'm really excited about it.

Before discovering this tool I even made a GitHub Action to run
Lighthouse on every push to my repositories.
